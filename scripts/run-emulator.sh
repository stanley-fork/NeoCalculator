# run-emulator.sh — Build AND run the NumOS SDL2 desktop emulator (macOS/Linux).
#
# The simplest, path-agnostic way to open the emulator window. It delegates to
#
#     pio run -e emulator_pc -t exec
#
# so PlatformIO itself builds (if needed) and then launches the native binary
# from whatever build directory it uses — you never need to know where the
# binary lives. In particular this sidesteps the Windows-only
# `build_dir = C:/.piobuild/numOS-build` line in platformio.ini, which on macOS/Linux
# would otherwise drop the binary into a literal ./C:/ folder in the repo (a
# common source of "I built it but nothing runs" confusion).
#
# Usage:
#     ./scripts/run-emulator.sh        # build if needed, then open the window
#
# Prereqs (macOS):  brew install platformio sdl2 pkg-config
# Prereqs (Linux):  sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev   (plus the pio CLI)
# Verify the CLI:   pio --version
#
# NOTE: the `-t exec` target cannot forward arguments to the emulator program.
# For advanced flags (--frames, --headless, --script, --screenshot, ...) build
# first, then use scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh, which runs the built binary
# directly and forwards everything after it. On Windows use
# scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1 (it also resolves SDL2.dll at runtime).
