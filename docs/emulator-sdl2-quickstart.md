# NumOS SDL2 Desktop Emulator — Quickstart

How to build and run the **native desktop emulator** (`pio run -e emulator_pc`) on
Windows and Linux. This is a desktop *port* of NumOS (the real LVGL/UI/math code
compiled against an SDL2 desktop HAL) — **not** a cycle-accurate ESP32 emulator.

**Controls:** [complete keyboard map](#keyboard-map-phase-3a). **Toolbox / Steps: F6;
Back: F8; Variables: V.**

## Windows: always-available release

Run `./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1` at any time, including during development.
The validated release and its DLLs live at
`C:/.piobuild/numOS/emulator_pc/program.exe`. PlatformIO builds into the separate
`C:/.piobuild/numOS-build` tree, so its automatic cleanup cannot remove that release.

To update it after building and checking a candidate:

```powershell
pio run -e emulator_pc
./scripts/publish-emulator-windows.ps1 -BuiltExecutable C:/.piobuild/numOS-build/emulator_pc/program.exe
./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1
```

The publisher checks the runtime and evaluates 2+3 in an isolated headless process
before replacing `program.exe` atomically. It keeps `previous-program.exe` and
leaves the active release intact on failure. If Windows refuses replacement while
the emulator is open, keep using that version and publish again after closing it.
Runtime DLLs must match the pinned active runtime; they are never overwritten
individually. The launcher prefers this stable release even when
`PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR` points to a private candidate build.

See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the persistent development rule.

## Do I need an ESP32-S3?

**No — not for the desktop emulator.** The emulator runs entirely on your computer
(Windows, Linux, or macOS). You only need a real ESP32-S3 board if you want to
*flash* NumOS onto physical calculator hardware.

| What you want to do | Build target | ESP32-S3 board needed? |
|:--|:--|:--:|
| Run NumOS **on your PC** (the emulator) | `emulator_pc` | **No** |
| **Flash** NumOS onto a real calculator | `esp32s3_n16r8` (and the other `esp32s3_*` targets) | Yes |

The ESP32 targets are **firmware builds only** — they compile the image that runs
on the chip. They are completely separate from the emulator, so the firmware can
build perfectly fine even when the emulator doesn't (and the other way around).

So the **one** command you need to build the desktop emulator is:

```bash
pio run -e emulator_pc
```

> **Always include `-e emulator_pc`.** If you run a bare `pio run` with no `-e`,
> PlatformIO builds **every** environment in the project — that's all five ESP32
> firmware targets *plus* the emulator. It still works, but it's much slower and
> compiles a lot of things you don't need just to try the emulator on your PC.

> **Seeing the ESP32 builds pass but `emulator_pc FAILED`?** That mismatch looks
> alarming but is common and expected — the firmware and the emulator are built
> independently, and the emulator just needs one extra desktop dependency (SDL2).

## Build vs. Run vs. Debug (and VS Code)

Four different things people confuse — especially in VS Code, where “Build”, the
**Run/Debug** play button, and the PlatformIO debug configs all look like ways to
“start” NumOS. They are **not** interchangeable:

| I want to… | Command | Opens the emulator window? | Needs an ESP32 board? |
|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|
| **Build the firmware** (image for real hardware) | `pio run -e esp32s3_n16r8` | No | No (just compiles) |
| **Build the emulator** (compile only) | `pio run -e emulator_pc` | **No** | No |
| **Run the emulator** (build **and** launch) | `pio run -e emulator_pc -t exec` | **Yes** | No |
| **Debug ESP32 hardware** (JTAG) | VS Code *Run/Debug* → “PIO Debug” | No | **Yes** |

The single most common macOS/Linux snag is doing the **build** step and expecting a
window: `pio run -e emulator_pc` **only compiles**. To actually see NumOS, you must
**run** it — add the **`-t exec`** target (PlatformIO builds if needed, then launches
the native binary):

```bash
pio run -e emulator_pc -t exec
```

`-t exec` is the most portable run command because PlatformIO launches the binary
from **its own** build directory — you never have to know the path (see
[Where the build goes](#where-the-build-goes-the-cpiobuild-path)). Equivalent
convenience wrappers:

| OS | One-step run |
|:--|:--|
| **macOS / Linux** | `./scripts/run-emulator.sh` (wraps `pio run -e emulator_pc -t exec`) |
| **Linux** (advanced: forwards `--frames`/`--headless`/`--script`…) | build, then `./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh <flags>` |
| **Windows** | `./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1` (also resolves `SDL2.dll`) |

> `-t exec` cannot forward arguments to the emulator program. For the Phase 3A+
> flags (`--frames`, `--headless`, `--script`, `--screenshot`, …) build first, then
> run the binary directly via the platform run script (above), which forwards
> everything after it.

### In VS Code — what to click (and what to avoid)

- ✅ **Run the emulator:** **Terminal → Run Task… → “Run NumOS Emulator”**
  (defined in [`.vscode/tasks.json`](../.vscode/tasks.json); it runs
  `pio run -e emulator_pc -t exec`). Or just type that command in any terminal.
- ❌ **Do not press Run/Debug (F5)** for the emulator. The repo's debug configs are
  **ESP32-only**: every entry in [`.vscode/launch.json`](../.vscode/launch.json) is a
  `platformio-debug` config bound to `esp32s3_n16r8` and `firmware.elf`. Launching
  one tries to attach a **JTAG debugger to physical hardware** and fails on a
  machine with no board connected. (That file is auto-generated by PlatformIO, which
  is why it has no emulator entry — use the **task** above instead.)
- ❌ **Do not pick “Electron Main.”** That's a generic VS Code/Node debug template,
  not part of NumOS — NumOS is a **C++/SDL2** desktop program, not an Electron app,
  so “Electron Main” has nothing to attach to.
- ❌ **“PIO Debug”, “PIO Debug (skip Pre-Debug)”, “PIO Debug (without uploading)”** —
  all three are the ESP32 JTAG configs above; none run the desktop emulator.

### Where the build goes (the `C:/.piobuild` path)

You may notice build output under a path like `C:/.piobuild/numOS-build/...` **even on
macOS or Linux**, which looks wrong. It isn't a bug or a leaked absolute path baked
into the binary — it's a configured **build directory**:

- [`platformio.ini`](../platformio.ini) sets `build_dir = C:/.piobuild/numOS-build` in the
  `[platformio]` section. This is a **Windows-only workaround**: the default
  `.pio/build/...` tree, nested under a long user path plus Giac/LVGL's deep include
  folders, can exceed Windows' 260-character `MAX_PATH` limit and break the
  **firmware** compile. A short absolute root keeps paths under the limit.
- On Windows, `C:/.piobuild/numOS-build` is an absolute path on the `C:` drive. On
  **macOS/Linux there is no `C:` drive**, so the same string is treated as a
  *relative* folder — PlatformIO creates a literal directory named `C:` **inside your
  repo** (`./C:/.piobuild/numOS-build/...`). Harmless, but confusing, and it means the
  plain run scripts (which look in `.pio/build`) won't find that binary.

**Is it safe to make portable?** Not by simply changing the line: it exists to keep
the Windows firmware build working, and PlatformIO has **no per-environment
`build_dir`**, so it can't be scoped to just the emulator. So it stays — and is
already neutralized everywhere it matters:

- **CI** overrides it with the `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR=.pio/build` job env (see
  [`.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml`](../.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml)),
  so no `C:` folder is ever created on the Linux runners.
- **You** have two clean options on macOS/Linux:
  1. **Use `-t exec`** (or `./scripts/run-emulator.sh`) and ignore the path entirely —
     PlatformIO runs the binary from wherever it built it.
  2. **Override the build dir** so everything lands in a normal `.pio/build`:
     ```bash
     PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR=.pio/build pio run -e emulator_pc -t exec
     ```
     With that set, `./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh` finds the binary too.

This quickstart covers **Phase 2** (reproducible, portable build & run with no
machine-specific SDL2 paths), **Phase 3A** (stable 320×240 logical scaling,
key press/release, and a headless auto-exit mode for CI — see
[Run modes](#run-modes-phase-3a) and [Keyboard map](#keyboard-map-phase-3a)),
**Phase 3B** (a deterministic fixed-step tick and a dependency-free PPM screenshot
dump for reproducible CI artifacts — see
[Deterministic mode & screenshots](#deterministic-mode--screenshots-phase-3b)), and
**Phase 4A** (deterministic scripted input replay — `.numos` scripts that inject
keys through the existing dispatch path and capture screenshots, see
[Scripted input replay](#scripted-input-replay-phase-4a)).

> The firmware build is completely separate and unchanged:
> `pio run -e esp32s3_n16r8`. Nothing here affects it.

## TL;DR

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell): build, validate/publish, run
pio run -e emulator_pc
./scripts/publish-emulator-windows.ps1 -BuiltExecutable C:/.piobuild/numOS-build/emulator_pc/program.exe
./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1

# Linux
sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev
PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR=.pio/build pio run -e emulator_pc
./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh

# macOS (Homebrew) — install the PlatformIO CLI first if `pio` is "command not found"
brew install platformio
brew install sdl2 pkg-config
pio --version                   # confirm the CLI is on your PATH before building
pio run -e emulator_pc -t exec  # build AND open the window (plain `pio run` only compiles)

# Timed / headless smoke (auto-exit; no manual window close — see Run modes)
./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1 --headless --run-for-ms 5000 --quiet          # Windows

```

Diagnose your setup any time:

```bash

## How SDL2 is discovered (no hardcoded paths)

SDL2 include/library/link flags are injected at build time by
[`scripts/sdl2_env.py`](../scripts/sdl2_env.py), a PlatformIO `pre:` extra_script
wired **only** into `[env:emulator_pc]`. There are no `-IC:/SDL2/...` paths in
`platformio.ini` anymore.

| OS | Discovery method |
|:--|:--|
| **Windows** | An SDL2 *development* root (folder containing `include/`, `lib/`, `bin/`). Resolved from `NUMOS_SDL2_ROOT` → `SDL2_DIR` → `SDL2_ROOT` → the historical default `C:/SDL2/x86_64-w64-mingw32`. Links `-lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2`. |
| **Linux / macOS** | System SDL2 via `pkg-config sdl2`, falling back to `sdl2-config`, falling back to a bare `-lSDL2`. |

At runtime the **Windows** binary additionally needs `SDL2.dll`;
[`run-emulator-windows.ps1`](../scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1) finds it and
extends `PATH` for the child process only (it never edits your global `PATH`).

---

## Windows

### Prerequisites
- **PlatformIO Core** (`pip install -U platformio`).
- **A C++ compiler** — MinGW-w64 GCC (the project is built/tested with
  `x86_64-...-posix-seh` GCC).
- **SDL2 MinGW development package** — download `SDL2-devel-2.x.y-mingw` from
  <https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases> and extract it. You want the
  `x86_64-w64-mingw32` subfolder (it contains `include/`, `lib/`, `bin/`).

  > ABI note: use a **MinGW** SDL2 dev package (not the MSVC one). The project's
  > known-good combo is the SDL2 `x86_64-w64-mingw32` prebuilt with MinGW-w64 GCC.

### Point the build at SDL2
Either drop it at the default location `C:\SDL2\x86_64-w64-mingw32`, **or** set an
environment variable (per-shell):

```powershell
$env:NUMOS_SDL2_ROOT = 'C:\path\to\SDL2-2.30.x\x86_64-w64-mingw32'
```

`SDL2_DIR` / `SDL2_ROOT` work too.

### Build & run
```powershell
pio run -e emulator_pc
./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1
```

The run script locates the executable (honoring the project's custom `build_dir`,
see [Build directory](#build-directory)), resolves `SDL2.dll`
(next to the exe → SDL2 root → `PATH`), then launches. Pass-through args are
forwarded: `./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1 <args>`.

---

## Linux

### Prerequisites
- **PlatformIO Core** (`pip install -U platformio`).
- **g++** (or clang++).
- **SDL2 dev package:**
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install -y SDL2-devel`
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S sdl2`

### Build & run
```bash
PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR=.pio/build pio run -e emulator_pc
./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh
```

Why `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR=.pio/build`? See [Build directory](#build-directory).

The run script locates the binary, sanity-checks the SDL2 runtime (`ldd` /
`ldconfig`), then runs it.

> **Status:** the Linux path is designed and the discovery logic is in place, but
> a Linux build has **not** been executed on the author's machine (Windows-only).
> The additive CI workflow
> ([`.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml`](../.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml))
> is the mechanism that will actually prove the Linux build; treat Linux as
> "expected to work, pending first green CI run" until then.

## macOS

> **New to PlatformIO on a Mac?** Start here. This is the exact flow for a fresh
> machine (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 or Intel) where the very first thing you see is
> `zsh: command not found: pio`.

### `zsh: command not found: pio` — what it means

This is the #1 first-run snag on macOS, and it does **not** mean anything is broken.
It just means the PlatformIO **command-line tool** (`pio`) isn't installed — or isn't
on the PATH of *this* terminal — yet. Nothing about NumOS or your Mac is wrong; you
only need to install the CLI.

> **The VS Code PlatformIO IDE extension is *not* the `pio` CLI.** If you installed
> the PlatformIO extension in VS Code, PlatformIO lives **inside the extension** and
> is only available in the dedicated terminal VS Code opens for it — the alien-head
> icon in the sidebar → *PlatformIO Core CLI* (a.k.a. "Open PlatformIO Core CLI").
> A plain macOS **Terminal** (or iTerm) window does **not** inherit that — a normal
> terminal needs PlatformIO installed as an ordinary shell command. Installing it
> with Homebrew puts `pio` on your system PATH so it works in *any* terminal, VS Code
> or not.

### Prerequisites
- **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh)** — the macOS package manager.
- **PlatformIO Core CLI** — `brew install platformio` (puts `pio` on your PATH).
- **SDL2 + pkg-config** — `brew install sdl2 pkg-config`. Homebrew's SDL2 ships
  `pkg-config`/`sdl2-config`, so the **same discovery path as Linux** applies (see
  [How SDL2 is discovered](#how-sdl2-is-discovered-no-hardcoded-paths)); there are no
  hardcoded paths to set.

### Build & run (copy-paste)

```bash
brew install platformio          # PlatformIO CLI  (skip if you already have it)
brew install sdl2 pkg-config     # SDL2 desktop dependency + pkg-config for discovery
pio --version                    # sanity check — prints e.g. "PlatformIO Core, version 6.x"
pio run -e emulator_pc -t exec   # build AND open the emulator window (one step)
```

**Always run `pio --version` before `pio run -e emulator_pc`.** If it prints a
version, the CLI is on your PATH and the build will find it. If it *still* says
`command not found` after `brew install platformio`:

- **Close and reopen the Terminal** so a new shell picks up the updated PATH, then
  retry `pio --version`.
- On **Apple Silicon**, Homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew/bin`; make sure that
  directory is on your PATH (a fresh `brew install` normally adds it). You can always
  invoke the CLI by its full Homebrew path: `$(brew --prefix)/bin/pio --version`.

> **Build vs. run.** Plain `pio run -e emulator_pc` **only compiles** — it does not
> open a window. The **`-t exec`** target (above) builds *and* launches, which is
> what you want when you "built it but nothing happened." See
> [Build vs. Run vs. Debug](#build-vs-run-vs-debug-and-vs-code). The convenience
> wrapper `./scripts/run-emulator.sh` does the same thing.

Once `pio --version` works, the line above builds the emulator exactly as on
Windows/Linux and opens the SDL2 window. Prefer `-t exec` (or `./scripts/run-emulator.sh`)
over `./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh` on a fresh checkout: the helper script looks in
`.pio/build`, but the default `build_dir` puts the macOS binary in a literal `./C:/`
folder (see [Where the build goes](#where-the-build-goes-the-cpiobuild-path)), so the
helper won't find it unless you also set `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR=.pio/build`.

> **Status:** the macOS path uses the same `pkg-config sdl2` discovery as Linux and is
> *expected to work*, but — like Linux — has not yet been proven by a green CI run on
> the author's machine. Treat it as "expected to work, pending first confirmation."

## Troubleshooting the emulator build

### "The ESP32 builds succeeded but `emulator_pc` failed"

This is the most common beginner snag, and it does **not** mean anything is wrong
with your ESP32 setup. The firmware targets and the emulator are built completely
separately, so the emulator can fail on its own — almost always because the
desktop graphics library **SDL2** is missing or can't be found.

Two things that trip people up:

- **Read the error *above* the summary, not the summary line.** When PlatformIO
  finishes it prints a results table that ends with something like
  `emulator_pc   FAILED`. That last line only tells you *that* it failed — the
  lines explaining *why* are the compiler/linker errors printed **above** the
  table. Scroll up and look for the first message containing `error:`. That is the
  useful part.
- **On Windows, this is almost always an SDL2 setup or path problem** — either the
  SDL2 development package isn't where the build looks for it, or `SDL2.dll` can't
  be found when the emulator runs. See [Windows](#windows) for how to install SDL2
  and point the build at it, and
  [How SDL2 is discovered](#how-sdl2-is-discovered-no-hardcoded-paths) for the
  exact search order.

### First, capture the full error

Build just the emulator, on its own, in **verbose** mode, and keep all of the
output:

```bash
pio run -e emulator_pc -v
```

The `-v` flag makes PlatformIO print the exact compiler/linker commands and their
full error text — that's what's actually needed to tell what went wrong.

It also helps to run the dependency checker, which reports whether SDL2 is visible
to the build:

```bash
python scripts/check-emulator-deps.py
```

### What to paste into a GitHub issue

If you're still stuck, please open an issue (or comment on yours) with **all** of
the following — it lets us help on the first reply instead of asking back and
forth:

1. **Your operating system** — e.g. "Windows 11", "Ubuntu 24.04".
2. **The exact command you ran** — e.g. `pio run -e emulator_pc -v`.
3. **The full `emulator_pc` error output** — the compiler/linker errors from
   *above* the summary table, not just the final `emulator_pc FAILED` line. Copy
   the whole block; the first `error:` line is the most important.
4. **Whether SDL2 is installed and on your PATH** — on Windows, where you put the
   SDL2 development package and whether `SDL2.dll` sits next to the emulator
   executable or is on `PATH`; on Linux, whether `libsdl2-dev` is installed.

> We can't promise a specific fix until we can see your actual `emulator_pc` error.
> The exact failure message is what tells us which dependency to point you at — so
> the full error from step 3 is the single most useful thing you can share.

---

## Run modes (Phase 3A)

By default the emulator is interactive (the window stays open until you close
it). Phase 3A adds a few command-line flags — **emulator-only; the firmware is
unaffected** — mainly so CI (or you) can launch it briefly without a human:

| Flag | Effect |
|:--|:--|
| `--frames N` | Run N main-loop iterations, then exit cleanly (liveness / no-crash smoke). |
| `--run-for-ms N` | Run ~N ms of wall-clock time, then exit cleanly. Prefer this for "did it reach the menu" checks — the splash is ~2 s, so use ≥ 4000. |
| `--scale N` | Integer window scale 1..8 (default 2). The logical surface is always 320×240; SDL scales it with crisp integer scaling. |
| `--headless` | Force `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` (no visible window) for CI / no-display hosts. You can also `export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` yourself. |
| `--quiet` | Silence the per-key / per-iteration debug logs (lifecycle logs remain). |
| `--deterministic` | **(Phase 3B)** Drive LVGL from a synthetic fixed-step clock instead of the wall clock. Animation/timer state becomes a function of the *frame index*, so a given `--frames N` is reproducible across runs and machines. Pair it with `--frames N`. See [Deterministic mode & screenshots](#deterministic-mode--screenshots-phase-3b). |
| `--step-ms N` | **(Phase 3B)** Virtual milliseconds advanced per frame in `--deterministic` mode, 1..1000 (default 16 ≈ 60 fps). No effect without `--deterministic`. |
| `--screenshot P` / `--dump-frame P` | **(Phase 3B)** After the final frame (before shutdown), dump the **320×240 logical** framebuffer to PPM (P6) at path `P`. Dependency-free; works under `--headless` and at any `--scale`. |
| `--script P` | **(Phase 4A)** Replay a deterministic input script (`.numos`) from path `P`: inject key events through the same dispatch path as live SDL input and capture in-script screenshots. Pair with `--deterministic --frames N`. See [Scripted input replay](#scripted-input-replay-phase-4a). |
| `--fs-root P` | **(FIX-01)** Use `P` directly as the emulated-LittleFS root (read-write, no copy). `--fs-root emulator_data` reproduces the historical interactive behavior explicitly. |
| `--fs-sandbox` | **(FIX-01)** Fresh empty per-run sandbox under the OS temp dir (`numos-emu-<pid>-<n>`). Deleted on exit 0; **retained** (path printed) on any error exit so the failure state is inspectable. |
| `--fs-sandbox-dir P` | **(FIX-01)** Shared sandbox at `P` (created if absent, never deleted by the emulator). This is the two-process persistence-roundtrip primitive. |
| `--help` | Print usage and exit. |

**Filesystem root resolution (FIX-01/FIX-02).** The three `--fs-*` flags are
mutually exclusive (conflict → exit 2 before SDL init). With no `--fs-*` flag:

- **`--script` and/or `--deterministic` runs default to a fresh temp sandbox**
  (same as `--fs-sandbox`). Scripted/CI runs therefore start from a clean
  variable state (all zeros — identical to the old committed `vars.dat`) and
  can never read or dirty the repo's `emulator_data/`.
- **Interactive runs (no script, wall clock) keep `./emulator_data`**, so local
  durable variables behave exactly as before. `emulator_data/` is git-ignored
  runtime scratch now — it is no longer tracked, and nothing committed depends
  on its contents.

Every run logs one greppable banner line with the resolved root, e.g.
`[FS] root=/tmp/numos-emu-1234-0 mode=sandbox` (modes: `sandbox`, `shared`,
`direct`).

The run scripts forward all flags, e.g.:

```bash
# Windows
./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1 --headless --run-for-ms 5000 --quiet
# Linux
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy ./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh --run-for-ms 5000 --quiet
```

A healthy timed run prints a `[SCALE] …` geometry line, reaches
`[MENU] Launcher cargado`, then `[SIM] auto-exit: …` and `[SIM] Bye!` (exit 0).
That is exactly what the additive CI workflow asserts
([`.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml`](../.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml)).

### Display scaling

The renderer presents a fixed **320×240 logical** surface
(`SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize`) with **integer scaling**
(`SDL_RenderSetIntegerScale`) and nearest-neighbor sampling, so pixels stay
crisp at ×2/×3/×4. This is *output* scaling only — the device geometry and the
math renderer are untouched. The startup `[SCALE]` log reports logical size,
window size, renderer output size, scale factor, integer-scale state, and the
selected backend (e.g. `direct3d(accel)` or `software`).

### Deterministic mode & screenshots (Phase 3B)

Phase 3B adds a **reproducible** headless mode plus a **screenshot** dump, so CI
can produce a stable visual artifact. Both are **emulator-only** and **opt-in**;
without the flags the runtime is byte-for-byte the Phase 3A behavior.

```bash
# Deterministic headless run that writes a 320x240 PPM screenshot
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy ./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh \
  --headless --frames 600 --deterministic --screenshot smoke.ppm --quiet   # Linux
./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1 `
  --headless --frames 600 --deterministic --screenshot smoke.ppm --quiet   # Windows
```

- **Deterministic tick.** Normally LVGL reads the wall clock
  (`lv_tick_set_cb(SDL_GetTicks)`), so the same `--frames N` samples animations at
  different real-time instants each run. With `--deterministic`, LVGL instead reads
  a synthetic counter the loop advances by `--step-ms` (default **16 ms**) **per
  frame**, *before* `lv_timer_handler()`. The visual state then depends only on the
  frame index — reproducible across runs/machines, with no `SDL_Delay`/VSYNC jitter
  (the per-frame sleep is skipped in this mode). The boot log states which clock is
  active: `[LVGL] lv_init() OK — tick = determinista (paso fijo por frame)` vs
  `… = SDL_GetTicks() (reloj de pared)`. At 16 ms/frame the ~2 s splash finishes by
  ~frame 125, so `--frames 600` lands well inside the launcher.
- **Screenshot.** `--screenshot PATH` (alias `--dump-frame PATH`) dumps the final
  frame just before shutdown. The source is the CPU-side full-screen LVGL buffer
  (`g_lvBuf`, RGB565, `LV_DISPLAY_RENDER_MODE_FULL`), so the image is always the
  **exact 320×240 logical display** — independent of `--scale` and valid under
  `--headless`. Output is **PPM P6** (a 3-line ASCII header + raw RGB), chosen to
  avoid any new dependency (no PNG/libpng). RGB565 is expanded to RGB888 by bit
  replication. A success line prints `[SHOT] PPM 320x240 escrito: <path>`.

> View a PPM with most image tools (GIMP, ImageMagick `display`/`convert`, IrfanView
> with plugins). To convert to PNG: `convert smoke.ppm smoke.png`.

**CI artifacts.** The additive emulator workflow
([`.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml`](../.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml))
runs this exact deterministic command and uploads, under the
**`numos-emulator-smoke`** artifact, both the run log (`emu-det-smoke.log`) and the
screenshot (`smoke.ppm`). Download it from the workflow run's *Artifacts* section.
The job only asserts the launcher was reached, the deterministic tick was used, and
the PPM exists and is 320×240 — it makes **no pixel-correctness claim yet** (that is
a later phase).

**Limitations.** Determinism covers LVGL's tick-driven animation/timer state; it
does not freeze any wall-clock reads elsewhere (there are none on the render path
today). The screenshot is the logical framebuffer, not the scaled host window. The
`--screenshot` flag captures once at exit; the **Phase 4A** `screenshot` script
command (below) adds per-frame capture during a scripted run.

### Scripted input replay (Phase 4A)

Phase 4A adds `--script PATH`: a deterministic, line-oriented **`.numos`** script
that injects key events and captures screenshots. Replayed keys go through the
**exact same dispatch path** as live SDL input (`dispatchKey` in
[`NativeHal.cpp`](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp)) — MENU navigation and CalculationApp
typing behave identically to a human at the keyboard. Like Phase 3B this is
**emulator-only** and **opt-in**; without `--script` the runtime is unchanged.

```bash
# Type "1+2", evaluate, screenshot — headless, deterministic, reproducible.
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy ./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh \
  --headless --deterministic --script tests/emulator/scripts/calc_1_plus_2.numos \
  --frames 1400 --screenshot out/calc_1_plus_2.ppm --quiet                    # Linux
./scripts/run-emulator-windows.ps1 `
  --headless --deterministic --script tests/emulator/scripts/calc_1_plus_2.numos `
  --frames 1400 --screenshot out/calc_1_plus_2.ppm --quiet                    # Windows
```

**Script syntax.** One command per line; tokens are whitespace-separated;
commands and key names are case-insensitive; paths are case-preserved and may not
contain spaces.

| Line | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `# ...` | Comment (whole line ignored). Blank lines ignored too. |
| `wait N` | Idle `N` emulator frames (`N ≥ 0`). At `--step-ms 16`, `N` frames ≈ `16·N` ms of virtual time. |
| `key NAME` | Inject a PRESS+RELEASE pulse of `NAME` (the normal "tap a key"). |
| `keydown NAME` / `keyup NAME` | Inject only the press / only the release. |
| `screenshot PATH` | Dump a 320×240 PPM at `PATH`, captured *after* this frame's render. |
| `log "message"` | Print `message` to stdout (handy for CI log markers). |
| `open_app NAME` | (Phase 5A) Launch an app directly by name through the same `launchApp()` the launcher uses — deterministic, no fragile grid navigation. `NAME` ∈ `Calculation`/`Statistics`/`Probability`/`Sequences`/`Regression`/`Settings`/`MathShowcase` (aliases `Calc`, `Stats`, `Prob`, `Seq`, `Reg`, `Showcase`/`Math_Showcase`). Use it from the launcher (MENU) state. |
| `assert_app NAME` | (Phase 4B-C / 5A) Assert the active app is `NAME` ∈ `Calculation`/`Menu`/`Splash`/`Statistics`/`Probability`/`Sequences`/`Regression`/`Settings`/`MathShowcase` (aliases `Calc`/`Launcher`/`Stats`/`Prob`/`Seq`/`Reg`/`Showcase`). |
| `assert_result TEXT` | (Phase 4B-C) Assert CalculationApp's *computed* result equals `TEXT` exactly (e.g. `3`, `5/6`). |
| `assert_result_contains TEXT` | (Phase 4B-C) Like `assert_result` but a substring match. |
| `assert_no_error` | (Phase 4B-C) Assert the last evaluated result has no error flag. |
| `assert_menu_focus NAME\|ID` | (Phase 9B) Assert the **launcher** card currently focused is `NAME` (a card name, case- and space-insensitive — e.g. `Grapher`, `fluid2d`) or a decimal card `ID` (`0..N-1`). Only meaningful in MENU mode (fails otherwise). Reads the focus via an emulator-only read-only accessor; unknown name/out-of-range id is a **parse** error (`exit 2`). See [Menu navigation parity](#menu-navigation-parity-phase-9b). |

**Key names** map onto existing calculator `KeyCode`s (no parallel key system).
See the [complete replay vocabulary](#complete-replay-key-names); common names include:

- digits `0`–`9`; operators `+` `-` `*` `/`; `^` (= `POW`); `.` (= `DOT`); `(` `)`.
- `ENTER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`.
- `BACKSPACE` (alias `DEL`), `AC` (alias `ESC`), `HOME` (alias `MODE`).
- `X`/`Y` (variables), `SQRT`, `SIN`/`COS`/`TAN`, `LN`/`LOG`, `PI`, `E`, `NEGATE`.
- `FRAC` — **alias for `/`**: in NumOS the division key *is* the fraction key
  (`KeyCode::DIV` → `insertFraction`), so `key /` and `key FRAC` are equivalent and
  both open a fraction template in VPAM mode.

**Scheduling model.** In deterministic mode the replay executes **one command per
frame**, *before* SDL polling, so the injected key is visible to that same frame's
tick advance and `lv_timer_handler()`. `wait N` consumes `N` frames; `screenshot`
is captured *after* the frame's render (so it reflects everything injected so far).
The whole script is parsed and validated **up front** — a malformed script aborts
before any frame runs.

**Example script** (`tests/emulator/scripts/calc_1_plus_2.numos`):

```text
# wait for splash -> launcher (~frame 125 @ step-ms 16; 200 for margin)
wait 200
key ENTER          # open Calculation (centered, default-focused card)
wait 60
key 1
key +
key 2
key ENTER          # evaluate
wait 120
screenshot out/calc_1_plus_2.ppm
```

**Where screenshots go.** Wherever the `screenshot PATH` (or `--screenshot PATH`)
argument points; the bundled scripts write under `out/` (git-ignored). PPM P6,
320×240, same dependency-free format as Phase 3B.

**Error handling (fail-fast, non-zero exit).** A bad script never runs partway:

| Condition | Exit |
|:--|:--|
| Success (all commands ran; any assertions passed) | `0` |
| Unknown command, invalid key name, missing argument, negative `wait`, unknown `assert_app` name, unknown/out-of-range `assert_menu_focus` card, unreadable script file | `2` |
| `screenshot` write failure at run time (bad path / disk full) | `3` |
| Assertion failure (`assert_*`) at run time (Phase 4B-C) | `4` |

Parse errors print `[SCRIPT] <file>:<line>: <reason>` to stderr; assertion failures
print `[ASSERT] <file>:<line>: FAIL - expected … got …` to stderr — both fail CI
loudly. Assertion diagnostics print regardless of `--quiet` (which only silences
per-frame noise).

**Determinism.** Two runs of the same scripted command produce **byte-identical**
PPMs (verified locally via SHA-256, and re-checked in CI by running
`calc_1_plus_2.numos` twice and comparing hashes).

**What Phase 4A does *not* do.** It proves scripted input is *deterministic and
reproducible*; it does **not** assert the pixels are *correct* (no OCR, no
golden-image diff). Confirming the *rendered pixels* read "`3`" is the golden flow
below; confirming the *computed value* is `3` is Phase 4B-C, next.

### Semantic assertions (Phase 4B-C)

Phase 4B-C lets a `.numos` script assert the value NumOS **actually computed**,
without OCR and without relying only on a golden image. The four `assert_*`
commands (see the syntax table above) read CalculationApp's evaluated result
through an **emulator-only, read-only** accessor (`debugLastResult()`, guarded by
`#ifdef NATIVE_SIM`), format the exact `vpam::ExactVal` to text
(`NativeHal::formatExactVal`: `3`, `5/6`, …), and compare. No pixels are parsed,
no renderer geometry is touched, and the firmware binary is unchanged (the
accessor is excised when `NATIVE_SIM` is undefined).

```text
# … type 1 + 2, press ENTER, let it settle …
key ENTER
wait 120
screenshot out/calc_1_plus_2.ppm   # capture FIRST, so the artifact exists even if an assert fails
assert_app Calculation             # active app is the calculator
assert_no_error                    # evaluation produced no error
assert_result 3                    # the computed value is exactly 3
```

Run it (exit 0 on pass, `4` on assertion failure):

```bash
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy ./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh \
  --headless --deterministic --script tests/emulator/scripts/calc_1_plus_2.numos \
  --frames 1400 --quiet
```

Each assertion prints `[ASSERT] <file>:<line>: PASS|FAIL - …` (the `actual='…'`
value is shown on both outcomes), regardless of `--quiet`. `tests/emulator/scripts/`
ships two asserting fixtures: `calc_1_plus_2.numos` (`== 3`) and
`calc_fraction_sum.numos` (`== 5/6`). CI runs both as a headless deterministic
**semantic smoke** (separate from the golden flow below).

**Semantic assertions vs. visual goldens — they are complementary, not redundant.**
`assert_result` proves the *math engine computed the right value*; it says nothing
about whether the 2D layout *draws* it correctly. A golden image proves the
*rendered pixels* match a human-accepted reference; it says nothing about
correctness unless a human vetted that reference. Use assertions for value
correctness (cheap, no human gate) and goldens for render correctness (human-gated).
**Current limitation:** assertions cover CalculationApp's `ExactVal` result only —
`formatExactVal` is exact for integers and pure fractions (what the fixtures
assert) and best-effort for radicals/π/e; there is no assertion of the *rendered*
output, and other apps are not covered.

### Candidate screenshots & golden comparison (Phase 4B-A)

Phase 4B-A adds the *machinery* for visual assertions: a way to generate
**candidate** screenshots, a dependency-free way to **compare** a candidate to an
accepted **golden**, and additive CI that uploads candidates and gates only when a
human-reviewed golden exists. It is tooling only — **no renderer, CAS, firmware,
or math-geometry change** — and it still makes **no semantic correctness claim** on
its own (that is a human decision at promotion time; automated result extraction is
Phase 4B-B).

**Generate candidates** (stdlib Python, Windows + Linux):

```bash
pio run -e emulator_pc
python scripts/generate-emulator-candidates.py
# -> out/emulator-candidates/launcher_smoke.ppm
#    out/emulator-candidates/calc_1_plus_2.ppm
#    out/emulator-candidates/calc_fraction_sum.ppm
#    out/emulator-candidates/settings_smoke.ppm        (Phase 5A)
#    out/emulator-candidates/math_showcase_smoke.ppm   (Phase 5A)
#    out/emulator-candidates/statistics_smoke.ppm      (Phase 6A)
#    out/emulator-candidates/probability_smoke.ppm     (Phase 6A)
#    out/emulator-candidates/statistics_data_smoke.ppm (Phase 6C; Phase 6D types {1,2,3})
#    out/emulator-candidates/probability_edit_smoke.ppm(Phase 6C; Phase 6D types mu=2.5)
#    out/emulator-candidates/sequences_smoke.ppm       (Phase 7A)
#    out/emulator-candidates/sequences_edit_smoke.ppm  (Phase 7A edits u(n)=2*n+5)
#    out/emulator-candidates/regression_smoke.ppm      (Phase 7C)
#    out/emulator-candidates/regression_data_smoke.ppm (Phase 7C fits y=2x; each 320x240, 230415 bytes)
```

**Deeper interaction smokes (Phase 6C, upgraded in Phase 6D).** Beyond the Phase 6A
default-open smokes, Statistics and Probability have scripts that drive the apps past
their default state with *real numeric entry*, proving they are *interactable*, not
merely launchable:

- `statistics_data_smoke.numos` types the dataset `{1, 2, 3}` into the value column —
  `1 ENTER`, then `AC DOWN 2 ENTER`, then `AC DOWN 3 ENTER` (the table starts with one
  row, `_numRows=1`; `AC` appends a row and `DOWN` moves to it) — and switches to the
  computed **Stats** tab with `GRAPH`. Reaching a computed tab from the Data tab requires
  the `GRAPH` key — on the Data tab `LEFT`/`RIGHT` are column navigation — so the emulator
  script-key table maps a `graph` token (`scriptNameToKeyCode`, `src/hal/NativeHal.cpp`,
  emulator-only, guarded by `#ifdef NATIVE_SIM` so it is firmware-neutral). The Stats tab
  then renders the 1-Var statistics via `switchTab` → `recompute()` →
  `updateStatsDisplay()`: over `{1,2,3}` that is `n=3, Mean=2, Median=2, Sum=6, Min=1,
  Max=3`.
- `probability_edit_smoke.numos` edits the focused `mu` field through the numeric
  editor: `ENTER` opens the editor (which pre-fills the buffer with the current value
  `0`), `DEL` clears it, `2 . 5` types the value, and `ENTER` commits via `finishEdit()`
  (`atof("2.5")` → `mu=2.5`) and `recompute()`s the PDF/CDF and bell curve, which centers
  at `2.5`.

Both new screens are **human-gated**: this phase makes **no golden claim** — the
candidates are for human review only, and no golden/mask is promoted automatically.
There are **no semantic numeric assertions** for Statistics/Probability yet (only the
`assert_app` smoke); adding one would require a read-only app-state accessor and is
deferred. A clock mask (shared rect `4,6,37,13`) is added by the human at promotion
time, as with the other app smokes.

It drives each bundled `.numos` script with `--headless --deterministic --script
--frames --screenshot`, writing one PPM per script into `out/emulator-candidates/`
(under git-ignored `out/`). `--bin` and `--out-dir` override the defaults.

**Compare** a candidate against an expected/golden PPM, byte-for-byte:

```bash
python scripts/compare-ppm.py EXPECTED.ppm ACTUAL.ppm [--write-diff diff.ppm]
```

It validates both are P6 320×240 maxval-255 with a full 230415-byte payload,
prints each file's dimensions / size / SHA-256, and on difference reports the
mismatching byte count, pixel count, and bounding box. `--write-diff` emits a PPM
that paints differing pixels magenta. Exit codes: **0** identical, **1** valid but
different, **2** invalid input. (Run it with the same file twice to validate a
single PPM's format — exit 0.)

**Masked comparison (Phase 4B-B).** Some screens are not byte-stable across
launches: the CalculationApp input cursor blinks (an `lv_timer` toggling every
500 ms), and the deterministic tick only pins the blink *phase within a single
run*, so spaced-apart launches differ inside a tiny band around the cursor.
`launcher_smoke` has no cursor and stays byte-stable; `calc_1_plus_2` /
`calc_fraction_sum` differ only inside `x[10..34] y[8..16]`. To compare them
anyway, ignore that region:

```bash
# Ad-hoc rectangle(s) (top-left origin, X,Y,W,H; repeatable):
python scripts/compare-ppm.py golden.ppm candidate.ppm --ignore-rect 8,6,30,13

# Or a committed mask file (one 'x,y,w,h' per line; '#' comments, blank lines ok):
python scripts/compare-ppm.py golden.ppm candidate.ppm \
  --mask-file tests/emulator/masks/calc_1_plus_2.mask --write-diff diff.ppm
```

Pixels inside an ignore-rect are excluded from the mismatch count, the bounding
box, and the equality decision (the diff image paints them **teal**). If the only
differences fall inside masks, the result is `IDENTICAL (after masking …)` → exit
0; differences *outside* a mask still exit 1. Rects with `x<0`, `y<0`, `w<=0` or
`h<=0` are an error (exit 2); rects past the frame edge are clipped.

**When is a mask acceptable?** Only for genuinely nondeterministic UI regions (the
blinking cursor). Keep it tight — never mask the expression or result pixels, and
never use a mask to hide a rendering bug (the renderer/cursor is frozen, so the
blink is masked in the comparator, not fixed in `src/`). A mask is **not** a
substitute for a semantic assertion that the result is correct — for *value*
correctness use the Phase 4B-C [`assert_result`](#semantic-assertions-phase-4b-c)
commands; render correctness remains a human judgement at promotion time. See
[`tests/emulator/masks/README.md`](../tests/emulator/masks/README.md).

**Promote a candidate to a golden (Phase 4B-D)** by visually confirming it is
correct, then using the human-run helper to do the byte-exact copy and commit it
(with its mask, if it needs one):

```bash
python scripts/promote-emulator-golden.py --list-candidates   # stem, sha256, golden/mask state
python scripts/promote-emulator-golden.py --dry-run calc_1_plus_2   # preview, writes nothing
python scripts/promote-emulator-golden.py calc_1_plus_2            # copy candidate -> golden
git add tests/emulator/golden/calc_1_plus_2.ppm tests/emulator/masks/calc_1_plus_2.mask
git commit -m "Accept golden+mask: calc_1_plus_2 renders 3 (cursor region masked)"
```

[`promote-emulator-golden.py`](../scripts/promote-emulator-golden.py) refuses a
missing or malformed candidate, refuses to clobber an existing golden without
`--force`, prints the promoted file's SHA-256, and reports whether CI will compare
it masked or byte-exact. It **never** generates images, **never** writes a mask,
and **never** commits — the commit is the human acceptance record. The equivalent
manual step is `cp out/emulator-candidates/<stem>.ppm
tests/emulator/golden/<stem>.ppm`. No *automated* step ever writes into
`tests/emulator/golden/` or `tests/emulator/masks/`; CI never invokes the promote
tool.

**Accepted goldens & the review gate.** Accepted, human-reviewed goldens live in
[`tests/emulator/golden/`](../tests/emulator/golden/) (committed; same stem as the
script). A candidate becomes a golden only by a human visually confirming it is
correct and then promoting + committing it:

```bash
python scripts/promote-emulator-golden.py calc_1_plus_2
git add tests/emulator/golden/calc_1_plus_2.ppm && git commit -m "Accept golden: 1+2 = 3"
```

No *automated* step writes into `tests/emulator/golden/`; the only writer is the
human-run promote helper, and it never commits.

**Updating a golden after an intentional UI/render change.** A deliberate render
change will (correctly) make the old golden mismatch. Regenerate candidates,
**re-confirm** the new one is correct, then re-bless with
`python scripts/promote-emulator-golden.py --force <stem>` (it refuses to clobber
a golden without `--force`) and commit the changed bytes in their own PR so the
old-vs-new diff is what reviewers approve. See
[`tests/emulator/golden/README.md`](../tests/emulator/golden/README.md) for the full
policy.

**CI behavior.** The emulator workflow
([`.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml`](../.github/workflows/emulator-build.yml))
generates candidates, uploads them under the **`numos-emulator-candidates`**
artifact, and then for each candidate:

- golden **and** mask present → **masked** compare (`--mask-file`), fails on
  mismatch outside the mask;
- golden present, no mask → **exact** byte compare, fails on mismatch;
- golden absent → prints a `::warning::` and continues.

So an unreviewed image can never silently become a passing gate, missing goldens
never fail CI (they just produce a downloadable candidate to review), and adding a
mask never weakens a screen that already compares exactly.

### Additional emulator apps: Settings & Math Showcase (Phase 5A)

Phase 5A widens emulator app coverage beyond CalculationApp with two **safe**
apps. Both are **emulator-only** wiring in
[`NativeHal.cpp`](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp); the firmware, the renderer geometry,
the STIX assets, and the CAS/Giac engine are **untouched**. Open either with the
new [`open_app`](#scripted-input-replay-phase-4a) script command (or, for
Settings, by navigating the launcher to its card and pressing ENTER).

**Settings.** The real, unmodified [`SettingsApp`](../src/apps/SettingsApp.cpp) —
the same LVGL-native panel the firmware ships (complex-numbers toggle, decimal
precision, step-by-step mode). It needs **no HAL work**: it touches only LVGL +
`ui::StatusBar` and the three `setting_*` globals already defined for the native
build ([NativeHal.cpp:103-105](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp#L103)). 

> **Settings persistence is in-memory only (both firmware and emulator).**
> `SettingsApp` reads/writes the `setting_*` globals directly; it performs **no**
> Preferences/NVS/flash persistence in either build, so there is nothing to stub.
> Changes last for the session. This is the app's existing design, not an
> emulator fallback.

**Math Showcase.** An **emulator-only**, screenshot-friendly display of a
*curated* subset of the **accepted** `MathRenderVisualCases`, rendered through the
same `MathCanvas` the firmware uses — with the **cursor OFF** (deterministic, no
blink), **no diagnostic colored overlays**, and **no per-case serial spam**. It is
deliberately **separate** from the diagnostic `MathRenderVisualTestApp` (which is
firmware-validation-only, behind `NUMOS_MATH_VISUAL_VERIFY`, and prints layout
dumps). The Showcase **builds nothing new**: it reuses the accepted renderer
geometry verbatim. Cycle the curated cases with LEFT/RIGHT (or UP/DOWN):

```text
1 + 2/3 + x^2      2 + 2/2      2^2      x^10      (2/3)^2      2^(1/2)      (1 + 1/2) / (x + 3)
```

> Math Showcase is **emulator-only** (not a firmware launcher card). The same
> expressions remain accessible to firmware validation through
> `MathRenderVisualTestApp` under `NUMOS_MATH_VISUAL_VERIFY`; the Showcase is the
> *clean, demo/screenshot* presentation of that shared, accepted case list.

**Smoke scripts.** `tests/emulator/scripts/settings_smoke.numos` and
`math_showcase_smoke.numos` each `open_app` the app, screenshot, and
`assert_app <Name>`. They are also wired into
[`generate-emulator-candidates.py`](../scripts/generate-emulator-candidates.py), so
CI generates and uploads their candidate PPMs and warns (does not fail) on a
missing golden — **no golden is blessed by this phase**.

```bash
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy ./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh \
  --headless --deterministic --script tests/emulator/scripts/settings_smoke.numos \
  --frames 800 --screenshot out/settings_smoke.ppm --quiet            # Linux
```

**Limitations.** Only `assert_app` (not `assert_result`) is supported for these
non-calculation apps in this phase. Settings persistence is in-memory only (see
above). Math Showcase is read-only display (it evaluates nothing). Both screens
are byte-deterministic within a run (verified by a back-to-back SHA-256 compare);
across runs the only volatile region is the StatusBar clock (`HH:MM`, ~`x[27..33]
y[8..16]`) — the same per-minute variation every status-bar screen has — so a
future golden would mask the clock, just as `calc_1_plus_2` masks the blinking
cursor.

### Additional emulator apps: Statistics & Probability (Phase 6A)

Phase 6A widens emulator app coverage with two more **safe**, LVGL-only educational
apps. As in Phase 5A, this is **emulator-only** wiring in
[`NativeHal.cpp`](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp); the firmware, the renderer geometry,
the STIX assets, and the CAS/Giac engine are **untouched**. Open either with the
[`open_app`](#scripted-input-replay-phase-4a) script command (or by navigating the
launcher to its card — Statistics or Probability — and pressing ENTER).

**Statistics.** The real, unmodified [`StatisticsApp`](../src/apps/StatisticsApp.cpp)
— a 3-tab panel (Data table editor / computed Stats / histogram) backed by a pure
`<vector>`/`<cmath>` [`StatsEngine`](../src/apps/StatsEngine.cpp). It needs **no HAL
work**: it touches only LVGL + `ui::StatusBar` + `KeyboardManager`, with no Giac,
no filesystem, no `heap_caps`/PSRAM, and no sensors. It opens on the **Data** tab, so
no statistics are computed on open (no empty-dataset edge case).

**Probability.** The real, unmodified [`ProbabilityApp`](../src/apps/ProbabilityApp.cpp)
— a normal-distribution N(μ, σ) explorer with an `lv_chart` bell curve and PDF/CDF
readout, backed by a pure `<cmath>` [`ProbEngine`](../src/apps/ProbEngine.cpp). Same
dependency profile as Statistics. It opens with defaults μ=0, σ=1, x=0 (σ≠0, so the
curve computation has no division-by-zero).

> Both apps are the **same code the firmware ships** (already compiled there via
> `+<*>`); Phase 6A only adds their `.cpp` to the native
> [`build_src_filter`](../platformio.ini#L188) and routes `open_app`/`assert_app`/
> launcher id 4 (Statistics) and 5 (Probability) in `NativeHal.cpp`. No app logic is
> modified.

**Smoke scripts.** `tests/emulator/scripts/statistics_smoke.numos` and
`probability_smoke.numos` each `open_app` the app, screenshot, and
`assert_app <Name>`. They are wired into
[`generate-emulator-candidates.py`](../scripts/generate-emulator-candidates.py), so
CI generates and uploads their candidate PPMs and **warns (does not fail)** on a
missing golden — **no golden is blessed by this phase**.

```bash
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy ./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh \
  --headless --deterministic --script tests/emulator/scripts/statistics_smoke.numos \
  --frames 800 --screenshot out/statistics_smoke.ppm --quiet           # Linux
```

**Limitations.** These two apps are **smoke-only** (open + `assert_app` + screenshot);
they have **no `assert_result`-style semantic assertions** (that path is
CalculationApp-only). Both open in their default state and are not driven with data
entry in this phase. As with every emulator screen the only across-run volatile
region is the StatusBar clock (`HH:MM`); a future golden would mask it, exactly as
`calc_1_plus_2` masks the blinking cursor.

### Additional emulator app: Sequences (Phase 7A)

Phase 7A enables **one** more **safe**, LVGL-only app. As before this is
**emulator-only** wiring in [`NativeHal.cpp`](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp); the firmware,
the renderer geometry, the STIX assets, and the CAS/Giac engine are **untouched**.
Open it with the [`open_app`](#scripted-input-replay-phase-4a) script command (`open_app
Sequences`, alias `Seq`) or by navigating the launcher to its **Sequences** card and
pressing ENTER.

**Sequences.** The real, unmodified [`SequencesApp`](../src/apps/SequencesApp.cpp) — a
2-tab panel (**Define** sequence expressions `u(n)`, `v(n)` / **Table** of computed
values). It is even leaner than Statistics/Probability: it has **no engine companion
file**, evaluating sequences with a self-contained `sscanf`-based `recompute()`
([SequencesApp.cpp:323-367](../src/apps/SequencesApp.cpp#L323)) over `double`. It needs
**no HAL work**: it touches only LVGL + `ui::StatusBar` + `KeyboardManager`, with no
Giac, no filesystem, no `heap_caps`/PSRAM, and no sensors. It opens on the **Define**
tab showing the static defaults `u(n)=2*n+1` and `v(n)=n^2`. It has **no `update()`
method and no cursor/caret blink**, so screenshots are byte-stable apart from the clock.

> SequencesApp is the **same code the firmware ships** (already compiled there via
> `+<*>`); Phase 7A only adds its `.cpp` to the native
> [`build_src_filter`](../platformio.ini#L188) and routes `open_app`/`assert_app`/
> launcher id 7 in `NativeHal.cpp`. No app logic is modified. SequencesApp already uses
> the order-independent `keyCodeDigitValue()` helper for digit entry, so it never had
> the Phase 6D `NUM_0..NUM_9` range bug.

**Smoke scripts.** Two scripts, both wired into
[`generate-emulator-candidates.py`](../scripts/generate-emulator-candidates.py) (CI
generates/uploads their candidate PPMs and **warns — does not fail — on a missing
golden**; **no golden is blessed by this phase**):

- `tests/emulator/scripts/sequences_smoke.numos` — `open_app Sequences`, screenshot the
  default Define tab, `assert_app Sequences`.
- `tests/emulator/scripts/sequences_edit_smoke.numos` — edits `u(n)` from `2*n+1` to
  `2*n+5` (`ENTER`, `DEL`, `5`, `ENTER`), switches to the Table tab (`RIGHT`) so
  `recompute()` reruns over the edit, screenshots, and `assert_app Sequences`. The edit
  stays inside `recompute()`'s linear `%lf*n+%lf` branch and never types the variable
  `n` (no key maps to it), keeping it deterministic.

```bash
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy ./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh \
  --headless --deterministic --script tests/emulator/scripts/sequences_smoke.numos \
  --frames 800 --screenshot out/sequences_smoke.ppm --quiet             # Linux
```

**Limitations.** Sequences is **smoke-only** (open/edit + `assert_app` + screenshot); it
has **no `assert_result`-style semantic assertions** (that path is CalculationApp-only).
`recompute()` only recognizes the patterns `a*n^2+b`, `a*n+b`, bare `n`, and constants —
other expressions silently evaluate to 0 ([SequencesApp.cpp:333](../src/apps/SequencesApp.cpp#L333));
this is a pre-existing app limitation, not introduced here. As with every emulator screen
the only across-run volatile region is the StatusBar clock (`HH:MM`); a future golden
would mask it (rect `4,6,37,13`). **No Sequences golden has been accepted yet.**

### Additional emulator app: Regression (Phase 7C)

Phase 7C enables **one** more **safe**, LVGL-only app. As before this is
**emulator-only** wiring in [`NativeHal.cpp`](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp); the firmware,
the renderer geometry, the STIX assets, and the CAS/Giac engine are **untouched**.
Open it with the [`open_app`](#scripted-input-replay-phase-4a) script command (`open_app
Regression`, alias `Reg`) or by navigating the launcher to its **Regression** card and
pressing ENTER.

**Regression.** The real, unmodified [`RegressionApp`](../src/apps/RegressionApp.cpp) — a
3-tab panel (**Data** X/Y table editor / **Equation** fitted model / **Graph** scatter +
curve) backed by a pure `<cmath>` [`RegressionEngine`](../src/apps/RegressionEngine.cpp)
(least-squares linear/quadratic via Cramer's rule, plus R²). It needs **no HAL work**: it
touches only LVGL + `ui::StatusBar` + `KeyboardManager`, with no Giac, no filesystem, no
`heap_caps`/PSRAM, and no sensors. It opens on the **Data** tab with one empty row, so no
regression is computed on open (no empty-dataset edge case). It has **no `update()` method
and no timer-driven cursor blink** ([RegressionApp.cpp:707-735](../src/apps/RegressionApp.cpp#L707)),
so screenshots are byte-stable apart from the clock.

> RegressionApp is the **same code the firmware ships** (already compiled there via
> `+<*>`); Phase 7C only adds its `.cpp` + `RegressionEngine.cpp` to the native
> [`build_src_filter`](../platformio.ini#L188) and routes `open_app`/`assert_app`/
> launcher id 6 in `NativeHal.cpp`. No app logic is modified. RegressionApp already uses
> the order-independent `keyCodeDigitValue()` helper for digit entry (fixed repo-wide in
> Phase 6E), so it never had the Phase 6D `NUM_0..NUM_9` range bug.

**Smoke scripts.** Two scripts, both wired into
[`generate-emulator-candidates.py`](../scripts/generate-emulator-candidates.py) (CI
generates/uploads their candidate PPMs and **warns — does not fail — on a missing
golden**; **no golden is blessed by this phase**):

- `tests/emulator/scripts/regression_smoke.numos` — `open_app Regression`, screenshot the
  default Data tab, `assert_app Regression`.
- `tests/emulator/scripts/regression_data_smoke.numos` — types the three points
  `{(1,2),(2,4),(3,6)}` into the X/Y table (`1 ENTER RIGHT 2 ENTER`, then `LEFT AC DOWN …`
  per row), switches to the **Equation** tab with `GRAPH` so `recompute()` runs the
  least-squares fit (`y = 2x`, `R²=1`), screenshots, and `assert_app Regression`. Entry
  uses only existing script keys; the Y-column editor briefly shows a leading `0` that
  `atof` absorbs, so the committed points are exact.

```bash
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy ./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh \
  --headless --deterministic --script tests/emulator/scripts/regression_smoke.numos \
  --frames 800 --screenshot out/regression_smoke.ppm --quiet             # Linux
```

**Limitations.** Regression is **smoke-only** (open/enter data + `assert_app` + screenshot);
it has **no `assert_result`-style semantic assertions** (that path is CalculationApp-only).
The Equation/Graph model can be toggled linear↔quadratic with `SHIFT`
([RegressionApp.cpp:846-867](../src/apps/RegressionApp.cpp#L846)); the bundled scripts use
the default linear fit. As with every emulator screen the only across-run volatile region is
the StatusBar clock (`HH:MM`); a future golden would mask it (rect `4,6,37,13`). **No
Regression golden has been accepted yet.**

## Keyboard map (Phase 3A)

**Toolbox is `F6`** in the desktop emulator. In Equations, solve first, then press
`F6` to open Steps. **`F8` is Back** and **`v` is VAR** (the variable picker in
an editor; result pagination or horizontal formula scrolling in Equations).
These three shortcuts require a rebuilt emulator; older binaries have no desktop
binding for these controls. Some laptops require `Fn` with a function key.

The tables below list **every live desktop binding** implemented by
`mapSdlToKeyCode` and `mapTextChar` in
[`NativeHal.cpp`](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp). A binding sends a calculator key;
its effect depends on the active app and screen. Unlisted PC keys are unmapped.

### Navigation, controls and modifiers

| PC key | Calculator key | Action / note |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `Enter` / numeric-keypad Enter | `ENTER` | Confirm, evaluate, or activate the selected item; also serves the UI's EXE instruction |
| Arrow keys | `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` | Navigate, move the math cursor, or scroll according to the current view |
| `Home` / `h` | `MODE` | Return to the launcher |
| `Esc` | `AC` | Clear or cancel according to the app; also returns from Equations Steps |
| `Backspace` / `Delete` | `DEL` | Delete; also returns from Equations Steps |
| **`F6`** | **`TOOLBOX`** | **Open the contextual toolbox; open Steps from Equations results** |
| **`F8`** | **`BACK`** | **Go back / cancel in apps that handle BACK** |
| **`v`** | **`VAR`** | **Variable picker; Equations result-set pagination / Steps math scrolling** |
| Left / right `Shift` | `SHIFT` | Calculator modifier; see the layout-aware typing note below |
| `Tab` | `ALPHA` | Calculator ALPHA modifier |
| `Insert` | `STO` | Store modifier in apps that support it |
| `F5` / typed `=` | `FREE_EQ` | Exact/decimal format where supported; inserts equality in equation editors; does not evaluate |

### Functions, variables and constants

| PC key | Calculator key | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `s` | `SIN` | Sine |
| `c` | `COS` | Cosine |
| `t` | `TAN` | Tangent |
| `l` | `LN` | Natural logarithm |
| `m` | `LOG` | Base-10 logarithm |
| `b` | `LOG_BASE` | Logarithm with an explicit base |
| `r` | `SQRT` | Square-root template |
| `p` | `POW` | Power template without needing a shifted `^` |
| `f` | `DIV` | Fraction template; same calculator key as `/` |
| `o` | `CONST_PI` | Pi |
| `e` | `CONST_E` | Euler's number |
| `x` / `y` | `VAR_X` / `VAR_Y` | Variables x / y; use `v` to select z in Equations |
| `a` | `ANS` | Recall the last answer |
| `n` | `NEGATE` | Sign-change key where supported; use typed `-` for unary minus in equation entry |
| `g` | `GRAPH` | Open Grapher from the launcher; app-specific graph/tab action elsewhere |

### Layout-aware numbers and symbols

| Typed character | Calculator key |
|:--|:--|
| `0`–`9` | `NUM_0`–`NUM_9` |
| `+` / `-` / `*` / `/` | `ADD` / `SUB` / `MUL` / `DIV` |
| `(` / `)` | `LPAREN` / `RPAREN` |
| `^` | `POW` |
| `.` | `DOT` |
| `=` | `FREE_EQ` |
| `<` / `>` | `LESS` / `GREATER` (Grapher inequalities) |

Type symbols using your operating system's keyboard layout. Digits and symbols
arrive through **SDL text input**, after the OS resolves Shift / AltGr / dead keys;
they are not guessed from US key positions. For example, on a Spanish layout,
Shift+7 produces `/` and Shift+8/9 produces parentheses. The numeric keypad works
when it emits those characters (normally with Num Lock enabled). A comma is not
mapped to a decimal point.

Navigation, modifiers, function keys and letter shortcuts use SDL key-down/up
instead. Letter text input is ignored, avoiding duplicate insertion. A held mapped
key emits REPEAT; apps decide which actions may repeat. Calculator SHIFT/ALPHA
state is app-managed: watch the global modifier badges. This direct PC map is not
the production physical keypad's full set of shifted/alpha legends.

### Equations Steps: desktop controls

| Task | PC key |
|:--|:--|
| Open the checked explanation from results | `F6` |
| Previous / next teaching page | Left / Right |
| Toggle guided / summary (the checked derivation is reused) | `Enter` |
| Scroll prose, equations, cases and restrictions | Up / Down |
| Pan wide mathematics; cycle back to the start after its last segment | `v` |
| Return to the ordinary result | `F8` (also `Esc` / `Backspace` / `Delete`) |
| Return to the launcher | `Home` / `h` |

Steps opens in guided mode: one instructional operation at a time. Summary mode
retains intermediate equations. The `<>` and `^v` footer hints denote the
horizontal and vertical arrow keys.

In the editor, `F8` cancels the draft and `Enter` commits it. On paginated results,
`v` selects the next solution set. Unsupported explanations keep the ordinary
answer available; see [Tutor coverage](TUTOR_ENGINE_01.md#supported-methods).

### Complete replay key names

These are `.numos` **script tokens**, not PC key combinations. Alphabetic tokens
are case-insensitive. Use `key NAME` for a press/release pulse, or `keydown NAME`
and `keyup NAME` separately. The complete current `scriptNameToKeyCode` vocabulary is:

| Calculator key / group | Script names and aliases |
|:--|:--|
| Digits | `0`–`9` |
| Arithmetic | `+` / `add`; `-` / `sub`; `*` / `mul`; `/` / `div` / `frac` / `fraction` |
| Power, decimal, parentheses | `^` / `pow`; `.` / `dot`; `(` / `lparen`; `)` / `rparen` |
| Equality / formatting | `=` / `freeeq` / `sd` |
| Inequalities | `<` / `lt` / `less`; `>` / `gt` / `greater` |
| Confirm and navigation | `enter`, `exe`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down` |
| Delete, clear, launcher, back | `backspace` / `del` / `delete`; `ac` / `esc` / `escape`; `home` / `mode`; `back` |
| Toolbox / legacy Steps | `toolbox` / `tools`; `steps` |
| Variables | `var`; `x` / `varx`; `y` / `vary` |
| Dedicated template keys | `square`, `physical_frac` (FRAC), `divide` (DIVIDE) |
| Functions | `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `ln`, `log`, `logbase` / `log_n` |
| Constants, answers, sign | `pi`, `e`, `ans`, `preans`, `negate` / `neg` |
| Modifiers | `shift`, `alpha`, `sto` |
| App-specific controls | `graph`, `table`, `zoom`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f5` |

**Function-key names differ between surfaces:** PC `F5` sends `FREE_EQ`, while
script `key f5` sends the calculator's `F5`. PC `F6` corresponds to
**`key toolbox`**, and PC `F8` to **`key back`**; `key f6` and `key f8` are not
script tokens. Likewise PC `v` corresponds to `key var`, not `key v`.

PC `F1`–`F4`, `F7`, and `F9`–`F12` remain unmapped. `TABLE`, `PREANS`, `ZOOM`,
and the distinct calculator `EXE` and `F1`–`F5` codes have script names but no
dedicated desktop shortcut. Other enum values are not automatically valid script
names. A control with no handler in the active app can still be a no-op.

The web emulator additionally exposes the semantic logical-key catalog in
[`wasm/numos-keypad.js`](../wasm/numos-keypad.js), including `TOOLBOX` (72),
`BACK` (70), and `VAR` (71). These IDs are not desktop function-key numbers.
Keyboard shortcuts require a focused emulator canvas and a WASM build containing
the current SDL map; a previously packaged web build does not acquire new bindings
from a native rebuild. Browser-reserved shortcuts may be intercepted by the browser.

### Input parity: live SDL vs `.numos` script vs SerialBridge (Phase 9A)

The emulator and firmware expose **three independent input vocabularies**, all
resolving to the same `KeyCode` enum. They are intentionally **not** 1:1 — each is
shaped by its medium:

| Surface | Where | Style | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Live SDL** | `mapSdlToKeyCode` ([NativeHal.cpp:279](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp#L279)) | real-keyboard keysyms; letters for functions (`s`=SIN, `c`=COS, `m`=LOG, `b`=LOG_BASE; `g`=GRAPH, `h`=Home — Phase 9F) | interactive window only |
| **`.numos` script** | `scriptNameToKeyCode` ([NativeHal.cpp:384](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp#L384)) | spelled names (`sin`, `cos`, `graph`, `ans`…) + symbols | the **test** vocabulary; widest coverage |
| **SerialBridge** | `processChar` ([SerialBridge.cpp:108](../src/input/SerialBridge.cpp#L108)) | firmware serial-monitor REPL: `w/a/s/d` nav, `c`=AC, `g`=GRAPH, line-buffered | device bring-up only; **not** emulator input |

Because SerialBridge has no arrow keys it overloads letters very differently from
the SDL map (e.g. `c`=AC vs SDL `c`=COS, `s`=DOWN vs SDL `s`=SIN, `t`=SIN vs SDL
`t`=TAN). **This divergence is by design** — do not assume a shared mnemonic across
surfaces. (Phase 9F aligned one pair: SerialBridge `g`=GRAPH now matches SDL
`g`=GRAPH.)

**Phase 9A additions** (new names → existing `KeyCode`s; no enum changes):

- Script `logbase` / `log_n` → `LOG_BASE` — closes the only `CalculationApp`-handled
  key ([CalculationApp.cpp:390]) that was previously unreachable by **both** maps.
- Script `zoom` → `ZOOM` — Grapher zoom-in ([GrapherApp.cpp:2440]); previously only
  reachable via the shared `+`/ADD case, with no dedicated token.
- Live SDL `a` → `ANS` — the one live-input gap with no workaround (recall last
  result). `GRAPH`/`TABLE` already have the tab-bar `←`/`→` workaround interactively.

**Known input limitations (deferred):**

- **`TABLE`, `PREANS`, `EXE`, `F1`–`F4` have no live-SDL key** — they are reachable
  through `.numos` script names (or web logical input). Interactively, switch to the Grapher Table tab with
  the tab-bar arrows; recall Ans with `a`. (PreAns is script-only.) *(Phase 9F:
  `GRAPH` now has live key `g` — opens/switches to the Grapher — and `LOG_BASE` has
  live key `b`, so both left this list.)*
- **`SDLK_F5` → `FREE_EQ`**, but script `f5` → `KeyCode::F5` — the physical F5 key
  and `key f5` differ; a known, intentional asymmetry.
- ~~**Menu arrow navigation differs from hardware.**~~ **Resolved in Phase 9B.**
  Emulator launcher arrows now route through the same `MainMenu::moveFocusByDelta`
  *2D-grid* model the firmware uses ([MainMenu.cpp:151](../src/ui/MainMenu.cpp#L151)),
  not LVGL's linear group order. See [Menu navigation parity](#menu-navigation-parity-phase-9b).
  (`open_app` remains the recommended way for *app* smokes to reach a specific app
  deterministically, independent of grid layout.)
- `NEGATE` (SDL `n` / script `neg`/`negate`) and `EXE` (script `exe`) dispatch to
  apps that have no handler for them (silent no-op in CalculationApp); use `-`/`sub`
  for unary minus and `enter` to evaluate.

**Phase 9A input-parity scripts** (golden-free; gated by CI's *Input parity smoke*
step, never by the golden compare):

- `input_alias_surface.numos` — fires every script alias (incl. the new
  `logbase`/`log_n`/`zoom`) at the launcher; an unknown/renamed token fails the
  load (`exit 2`). The canary for the alias map.
- `calc_input_extended.numos` — exact-integer Calculation smoke covering `SQRT`
  (`√9 == 3`) and `DEL`/backspace (`2 + 5 [DEL] 3 == 5`), neither covered by the
  existing `calc_*` scripts.
- `grapher_input_navigation.numos` — integrated `graph` → `ac` → `table` → `ac`
  tab navigation; asserts Grapher stays active through it.

### Menu navigation parity (Phase 9B)

Phase 9B closes the last Phase 9A input gap: **the emulator launcher now navigates
the Main Menu with the exact same 2D-grid focus model as the firmware**, instead of
LVGL's linear group order.

**What changed.** In the emulator MENU branch of `dispatchKey`
([`NativeHal.cpp`](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp)), the four arrow keys are now routed to
`MainMenu::moveFocusByDelta(dCol, dRow)` — the *same* call the firmware makes in
`SystemApp::handleKeyMenu` ([`MainMenu.cpp:151`](../src/ui/MainMenu.cpp#L151)) — with
the identical mapping:

| Arrow | `moveFocusByDelta` | Arrow | `moveFocusByDelta` |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `LEFT` | `(-1, 0)` | `RIGHT` | `(+1, 0)` |
| `UP` | `(0, -1)` | `DOWN` | `(0, +1)` |

The grid is **3 columns** with horizontal/vertical wrap and last-row clamping;
`col = id%3`, `row = id/3`, `maxRow = (APP_COUNT-1)/3`. So e.g. `DOWN` from card 0
moves to card **3** (one row down, same column), where the old linear order would
have moved to card 1. Only the down-edge (`PRESS`/`REPEAT`) moves focus — the arrow
`RELEASE` does not. **ENTER is unchanged**: it still goes through the LVGL keypad
path, and because `moveFocusByDelta` sets the LVGL group focus, a subsequent ENTER
fires `LV_EVENT_CLICKED` on the focused card and launches it — exactly as the
firmware does.

This is **emulator-only**: the firmware already used `moveFocusByDelta`, and the
read accessor below is excised from the device build (`#ifdef NATIVE_SIM`).

**`assert_menu_focus NAME|ID`.** A golden-free assertion (see the syntax table
above) that checks which launcher card is focused, via the emulator-only read-only
accessor `MainMenu::debugFocusedCardId()` (guarded by `#ifdef NATIVE_SIM`, so the
firmware is untouched). The token is a card **name** (case- and space-insensitive,
so `Fluid 2D` is written `fluid2d`) or a decimal **id** (`0..N-1`); an unknown name
or out-of-range id fails the script **load** (`exit 2`), and a focus mismatch — or
running it outside MENU mode — fails at run time (`exit 4`). The accessor resolves
tokens against the real `APPS[]` table, so names never drift from the launcher.

**Phase 9B menu-parity scripts** (golden-free; same assert-only CI contract as the
Phase 9A scripts — exit 0, ≥1 `PASS -`, no `FAIL -`; no screenshot, not in the
candidate list):

- `menu_nav_parity.numos` — an arrow tour (`right`/`down`/`left`/`up` + a vertical
  wrap) asserting the exact focused card at each step (`0→1→2→5→4→1→0→18→0`); a
  linear-nav regression would land on different cards and fail.
- `menu_enter_launch.numos` — focus the Grapher card by arrow, press ENTER, and
  `assert_app Grapher`: proves grid navigation and card activation stay in sync.

**Focused-card visual candidate (Phase 9C).** Phase 9B asserted the *logical*
focus; Phase 9C adds a screenshot so a human can confirm the focus **highlight
renders** on the right card. `menu_focus_grapher_smoke.numos` stays in the
launcher, moves focus RIGHT once (Calculation → Grapher), asserts
`assert_menu_focus Grapher`, waits for the focus overshoot to settle, and
screenshots the launcher with Grapher highlighted (it presses **no** ENTER and
launches **no** app — bookended by `assert_app Menu`). It is wired into
[`generate-emulator-candidates.py`](../scripts/generate-emulator-candidates.py),
so CI uploads its candidate PPM and **warns (does not fail)** on the missing
golden. Run1-vs-run2 is **byte-identical** (the focus animation is driven by the
deterministic tick; the launcher has no blinking cursor). **No golden is blessed
and no mask is added in this phase** — promotion remains a later, human-gated step.

**Phase 9F Grapher no-hang / function / template guards** (golden-free; same
assert-only CI contract as the Phase 9A/9B scripts — exit 0, ≥1 `[ASSERT] … PASS`,
no `[ASSERT] … FAIL`; not in the candidate list). Wired into the emulator workflow
as the *Grapher no-hang / function / template guard* step; a hang trips the
per-script `timeout` (nonzero exit → fail), a broken fix trips an assertion
(`exit 4`):

- `grapher_home_return_smoke.numos` — presses HOME (MODE) from every Grapher state
  (Expressions / Graph / Table / Trace / Templates modal / mid-edit) and asserts a
  return to the launcher each time, then re-enters. Before 9F's deferred teardown
  this hung on the first return.
- `grapher_tan_exit_smoke.numos` — `y=tan(x)` (asymptotes) plots, pans, traces, and
  exits without hanging.
- `grapher_functions_smoke.numos` — sin/cos/tan/ln/log insert + serialize + graph.
- `grapher_logbase_smoke.numos` — `log` with an explicit base inserts, renders,
  graphs (change-of-base identity), tabulates, and exits.
- `grapher_template_insert_smoke.numos` / `grapher_template_all_smoke.numos` —
  templates insert **real plottable** expressions (the `OpKind::Eq` serialization
  fix) and plot. The few screenshots these write under `out/` are uploaded for human
  inspection only — they are **not** in the candidate list and never gate.

**Phase 9G visual re-bless.** The six Grapher visual goldens (`grapher_smoke`,
`grapher_expr_smoke`, `grapher_graph_smoke`, `grapher_table_smoke`,
`grapher_trace_smoke`, `grapher_templates_smoke`) were re-blessed after the
Phase 9D/9E/9F render changes (fixed active-tab pill clipping; templates modal now
lists the real plottable expressions). Each reuses its existing clock-only mask
(`4,6,37,13`) **unchanged** — no new masks, no broadened masks, no source changes.

### Phase 10B: implicit-equation plotting + delimiter polish

Phase 10B teaches the Grapher to plot **implicit equations** F(x,y)=0 — relations the
single-valued y=f(x) adaptive sampler cannot draw — and polishes the synthetic math
delimiters. Both are **firmware** changes (shared code), visually confirmed in the
emulator. **No golden or mask is promoted**; all 19 existing goldens still compare
**IDENTICAL** (the showcase default `1 + 2/3 + x^2` has no parentheses, and the
template-preview / panel delimiters render at a size that uses the bundled font glyph,
not the vector fallback that was touched).

- **Implicit classifier** ([`GraphModel::preCacheRPN`](../src/apps/GraphModel.cpp)).
  An equation is **explicit** (fast sampler) only when one side is the bare variable
  `y` and the other side has no `y` (so `y=x^2`, bare `x`/`2x`/`sin(x)`, and the y=
  templates are unchanged). Everything else — `x=y^2`, `x^2+y^2=1`, `y=x^2+y^2` — is
  **implicit**: the model compiles both sides and exposes the residual
  `G(x,y) = lhs - rhs` via `evalImplicit` (evaluated with both `x` and `y`).
- **Renderer** ([`GrapherApp::plotImplicit`](../src/apps/GrapherApp.cpp)). Marching
  squares over a 3-px grid of `G` across the viewport draws the `G=0` contour into the
  Kandinsky buffer via the new `GraphView::drawSegmentPx`; NaN-corner cells (domain
  holes) are skipped. `evalAt` returns NAN for implicit slots, so trace/table/auto-fit
  skip them cleanly.
- **Delimiter polish** ([`drawStrokedDelimiter`](../src/ui/MathRenderer.cpp)). The
  vector fallback for tall parentheses now uses a font-weight-matched stroke
  (≈ emSize/8) so a synthetic `(` no longer reads lighter than the glyphs it wraps; the
  arc stays a hook-free quadratic. Confirmed on `(2/3)^2` (showcase) and `sin(30)`
  (CalculationApp).

**Warning-only scripts** (assert + screenshot, **not** in the candidate/golden list):
`grapher_implicit_circle_smoke` (`x^2+y^2=1`), `grapher_implicit_sideways_smoke`
(`x=y^2`), `grapher_implicit_ycircle_smoke` (`y=x^2+y^2`),
`grapher_explicit_parabola_smoke` (`y=x^2` regression), `math_showcase_delims_smoke`
(tall parens), and `calc_delimiters_smoke` (`sin(30)`). Run any with
`--headless --deterministic --script <path> --frames 1600 --quiet`.

### Phase 10C: equal-aspect (square-grid) Grapher

Phase 10C makes the Graph tab **aspect-ratio correct**: one unit in x equals one
unit in y in screen pixels, so circles render as circles instead of horizontally
stretched ovals. A **firmware** change (shared Grapher code), visually confirmed in
the emulator. **No golden or mask is promoted.**

- **Root cause.** [`GraphView`](../src/ui/GraphView.cpp) mapped each axis
  independently — `x` px/unit = `320/(xMax-xMin)`, `y` px/unit = `143/(yMax-yMin)`
  (`GRAPH_CANVAS_W=320`, `GRAPH_CANVAS_H=143`). With the default viewport that is
  16 vs 10.2 px/unit, so a unit circle became a 1.57:1 ellipse.
- **Fix.** New idempotent [`GrapherApp::normalizeAspect`](../src/apps/GrapherApp.cpp),
  called once at the top of `replot()` before `_view.setViewport()`, equalizes the
  world-units-per-pixel by **expanding the more-zoomed axis** about the current
  centre (never crops). Because it mutates the canonical `_xMin..\_yMax` (the single
  source of truth) and pan/zoom are ratio-preserving, **every** render — default,
  pan, zoom, autofit, zoom-box, trace recenter — stays square, and all consumers
  (trace cursor, POI markers, integral/tangent overlays, implicit contours, info
  bar) follow automatically. `plotImplicit` and `GraphModel` are unchanged.
- **Square grid cells + clean labels.** `drawGrid` and the axis tick-label callback
  now share one world-step ([`GraphView::squareGridStep`](../src/ui/GraphView.cpp),
  ~48 px target) for both axes, so grid cells are visually square and the numeric
  labels sit on grid lines (the old Y labels used a denser step and overlapped).
- **Trace/table on implicit curves fail gracefully** (no single y=f(x)): `evalAt`
  returns NaN, so the trace dot hides and table cells are blank — no crash/hang
  (`grapher_implicit_tabletrace_safe.numos`).

**Expected stale goldens (do NOT promote):** only `grapher_graph_smoke` and
`grapher_trace_smoke` — the two goldens that capture the graph canvas (grid+curve)
— differ after this change; the other 17 goldens (incl. the Grapher Expressions /
Table / Templates views and every non-Grapher screen) still compare **IDENTICAL**.

**Warning-only scripts** (assert + screenshot, **not** in the candidate/golden
list): `grapher_aspect_circle_smoke` (`x^2+y^2=1` → true circle),
`grapher_aspect_small_circle_smoke` (`y=x^2+y^2`), `grapher_aspect_sideways_parabola_smoke`
(`x=y^2`), `grapher_aspect_line_smoke` (`y=x` at 45° — the square-grid proof),
`grapher_aspect_sin_smoke`, and `grapher_implicit_tabletrace_safe`.

## Build directory

This repo sets `build_dir = C:/.piobuild/numOS-build` in `platformio.ini` (top
`[platformio]` section) to keep Windows build paths short (MinGW + deep
PlatformIO paths can hit the Windows path-length limit). Consequences:

- On **Windows** candidates build to
  `C:/.piobuild/numOS-build/emulator_pc/program.exe`. Publish them with the script
  above; the run script prefers `C:/.piobuild/numOS/emulator_pc/program.exe`.
- On **Linux/CI**, that `C:/...` value is not a sensible path. Override it with
  `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR=.pio/build` (recommended), which is what the commands and
  CI above do. The firmware CI also strips the line with `sed`.
- After the stable-release check on Windows, fallback build directories resolve as:
  `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR` → `build_dir` from `platformio.ini` (ignored on
  non-Windows if it is a `C:\` path) → `.pio/build`.

## Known limitations (Phase 3A)

- **Native Giac is unavailable.** All Giac entry points are `#ifdef ARDUINO`
  ([GiacBridge.h:19,29](../src/math/giac/GiacBridge.h#L19)); the emulator does not
  compile or call Giac. The Giac library is intentionally excluded from the native
  build (`lib_ignore = giac libtommath`, [platformio.ini:185](../platformio.ini#L185)).
- **BigInt parity is not guaranteed.** The in-tree `cas::` engine builds natively
  but with `CAS_HAS_BIGINT 0` ([CASInt.h:53-59](../src/math/cas/CASInt.h#L53)) —
  int64 only; on overflow it returns an error state rather than promoting to
  arbitrary precision like the device. Large factorials / huge exact fractions can
  differ from hardware. Small results (e.g. `1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6`) are fine.
- **Not a cycle-accurate ESP32 emulator.** No Xtensa CPU emulation, no ILI9341 /
  SPI / DMA timing, no real PSRAM/`heap_caps` behavior (PSRAM is plain `malloc`).
- **Hardware keyboard matrix is not emulated.** The physical 5×10 GPIO scan
  (`drivers/Keyboard`) is not compiled natively; PC keys are mapped directly to
  `KeyCode` in [NativeHal.cpp](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp) (`mapSdlToKeyCode`).
  As of Phase 3A, `KEYUP` produces `RELEASE` and `Insert`→`STO` is mapped (see
  [Keyboard map](#keyboard-map-phase-3a)); full matrix / serial-text input is
  still future. SHIFT/ALPHA/STO are only meaningful inside CalculationApp, not
  in the launcher.
- **CalculationApp, Settings, Math Showcase, Statistics, Probability, Sequences, and
  Regression are wired** in the emulator (Settings + Math Showcase in Phase 5A; Statistics +
  Probability in Phase 6A; Sequences in Phase 7A; Regression in Phase 7C); the remaining apps
  still print "no implementada" ([NativeHal.cpp](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp)). Settings,
  Statistics, Probability, Sequences, and Regression are real firmware apps; Math Showcase is
  emulator-only. See
  [Additional emulator apps (Phase 5A)](#additional-emulator-apps-settings--math-showcase-phase-5a),
  [Statistics & Probability (Phase 6A)](#additional-emulator-apps-statistics--probability-phase-6a),
  [Sequences (Phase 7A)](#additional-emulator-app-sequences-phase-7a),
  and [Regression (Phase 7C)](#additional-emulator-app-regression-phase-7c).
- **Scripted input replay, golden tooling, AND semantic value assertions exist;
  rendered-pixel assertion does not.** Phase 3A adds `--frames` / `--run-for-ms` /
  `--headless` for unattended boot smokes, Phase 3B adds `--deterministic` +
  `--screenshot` for a reproducible 320×240 PPM artifact, Phase 4A adds `--script`
  for deterministic `.numos` input replay (see
  [Scripted input replay](#scripted-input-replay-phase-4a)), **Phase 4B-A**
  adds candidate-screenshot generation + a dependency-free PPM comparator + a
  human-gated golden directory, **Phase 4B-B** adds cursor-safe masking
  (`--ignore-rect` / `--mask-file`) so calc screenshots compare despite cursor
  blink (see
  [Candidate screenshots & golden comparison](#candidate-screenshots--golden-comparison-phase-4b-a)),
  and **Phase 4B-C** adds `assert_*` commands that check the value CalculationApp
  actually *computed* — no OCR, no pixels — via an emulator-only read-only probe
  (see [Semantic assertions](#semantic-assertions-phase-4b-c)). Byte-comparison
  against a golden (even masked) only proves a candidate equals a human-accepted
  image; a Phase 4B-C assertion proves the *math result* is correct but says
  nothing about the *rendered pixels*. Still future: asserting that the rendered
  output reads `3` *without* a hand-reviewed golden (e.g. OCR), and extending
  assertions beyond CalculationApp's `ExactVal` result. The interactive window
  (no `--script`/`--frames`) still runs until you close it.

## Troubleshooting

### "SDL2.dll could not be located" (Windows, at runtime)
The build succeeded but the DLL isn't reachable. Do one of:
- copy `SDL2.dll` next to `program.exe`, **or**
- set `NUMOS_SDL2_ROOT` to your SDL2 dev folder (the one with `bin\SDL2.dll`), **or**
- add the SDL2 `bin` folder to `PATH` for your shell.

The run script searches all three; run it after fixing one.

### "SDL2 development root not found" / "cannot find SDL headers/libs" (build)
- **Windows:** the extra_script couldn't find an SDL2 dev root. Set
  `NUMOS_SDL2_ROOT` (see [Windows](#windows)) and rebuild.
- **Linux:** install `libsdl2-dev` (or distro equivalent) so `pkg-config sdl2`
  succeeds. Verify with `pkg-config --modversion sdl2`.
- Run `python scripts/check-emulator-deps.py` for a full diagnosis.

### Emulator builds but the window does not open
- **Linux headless / SSH:** there is no display. Either run on a desktop session,
  or run with `--headless` (or `export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`). Pair it with
  `--run-for-ms N` so it auto-exits instead of running forever, e.g.
  `./scripts/run-emulator-linux.sh --headless --run-for-ms 5000 --quiet`.
- Check stdout: a healthy boot prints `[SDL2] Ventana ... creada OK`, a
  `[SCALE] ...` line, and reaches `[MENU] Launcher cargado`.
- If `SDL_CreateRenderer` fails (e.g. no GPU under the dummy driver), the code
  already falls back to the software renderer
  ([NativeHal.cpp](../src/hal/NativeHal.cpp), `SDL_RENDERER_SOFTWARE`); the
  `[SCALE]` log shows `backend=software(software)` in that case.

### The window opens but no keys work
- **Focus:** the SDL window must have OS keyboard focus — click it once.
- **Mode matters:** in the launcher (MENU) only arrows, `Enter`, `Esc`, and
  `Backspace` do anything (LVGL grid navigation); digits/operators are ignored
  there by design. Press `Enter` on the *Calculation* card first, then type.
- **Check the log (omit `--quiet`):** each accepted key prints
  `[KEY] SDL=<name> code=<n> action=PRESS|REPEAT|RELEASE mode=<MODE>`. If you
  see `[KEY] sin-mapear SDL=<name>` the key has no calculator mapping — consult
  the [Keyboard map](#keyboard-map-phase-3a) (note `(` / `)` / `*` need the same
  Shift combos as on a US keyboard).
- **STO:** press `Insert` (the only key bound to `KeyCode::STO`); it is
  meaningful only inside CalculationApp.

### The firmware build is separate
The emulator and firmware are independent PlatformIO environments. The emulator
work never changes firmware behavior:

```bash
pio run -e esp32s3_n16r8        # production firmware (unchanged by Phase 2)
```

If a firmware build misbehaves, it is not related to the emulator scripts/config.
